# LAL_plusplus
The LAL++ library (for quick creation of GUIs in C++ under X11) 

LAL++ allows to build easily GUIs for programs written in C++ under the X-Window/X11 graphic-system (used in Unix/Linux). Each variable is linked to a widget that represents the value of the variable. LAL++ can create group of buttons, keyboard input/output (of numbers and character strings), 1-D plots, 2-D maps, etc... Array of complex numbers can also be represented (LAL++ was originally created to test image-processing algorithms involving Fourier transforms).
